Implementation for PC-KroSBL
---------------------------------------------------
> start a new simulation
run main.m

> reproduce the results in the paper
1. unzip the compressed file in Results and 
2. go to the end of main.m and use the functions at the end of main.m to reproduce the plot in the paper


All the files are tested in Matlab 2019b, but any later version should also work.
A run for a simulation (50 averages) might take ~12 hours


If you use the code here, please also cite the PC-SBL paper.
